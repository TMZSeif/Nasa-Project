# Egypteroids

In this project, we created an interactive program that simulates the impact of some of the closest asteroids to Earth. Using real asteroid data, the program simulates the potential consequences of a collision, helping users better understand the destruction of near-Earth objects (NEOs).

We also designed a defense mode that enables players to actively defend Earth against incoming asteroids. This adds a gamified experience to our simulation project!

The project combines education and interactivity, raising awareness of asteroid threats while inspiring curiosity about space exploration.
